2 ways to create React applications

1. Simple React application:

	- We import the 3 libraries(React, ReactDOM and Babel for JSX)
2. Complex React applications:
	- Here we use build tools like create-react-app, webpack, cssLoaders, styleLoaders, transpiler (babel),minifies, compression libraries.
	- Here we utilize nodejs to facilitate the development and it monitors the changes and apllies them dynamically.
